# OSRS_ge_tracker

This is a simple Python script that scrapes active trading prices directly from the OSRS website. This is a simple side project that I worked on for fun; I enjoyed getting practice with Python and learning web scraping.

I utilize three packages in this.

1. BeautifulSoup4 - used to submit my GET requests
2. cfscrape - used to bypass Cloudfare's bot detection
3. osrsbox - used for item identification and setting up for my data scrape
