# OSRS_ge_tracker
Hi!

This is a simple Python script that scrapes active trading prices directly from the OSRS website. This is a simple side project that I worked on for fun; I enjoyed getting practice learning Python and webscraping.

I utilize only three packages in this.

1. BeautifulSoup4 - used to submit my GET requests
2. osrsbox - used for item identification and setting up for my data scrape
3. cfscrape - also used for GET requests
